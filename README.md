# DiscordStudySessionRP
This is just a simple (windows) program, which displays how long your study session is going to take to end on your discord profile, it also acts as somewhat of a timer and notifies you when your study session is over

Utilizes [Pizzabelly/EasyRP](http://github.com/Pizzabelly/EasyRP) to display things on your discord profile
